I am interested in taking DATA 602, 'Principles of Data Science,' because I hope that it will help me build my foundations in data science. Since I am beginning my career in Data Science, this course would help me with conceptual knowledge as well as learning the tools of the trade. I do have prior experience with Python, being a software test engineer for almost 5 years, and through this course I hope to supplement my knowledge in machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and the know-how to make informed decisions in this field.
